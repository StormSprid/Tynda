00:12;I'm going back to 505
00:16;If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive

00:30;With your hands between your thighs

00:43;Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?

01:02;♪
01:08;Not shy of a spark
01:11;A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark

02:47;Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
02:52;♪
02:56;I'm going back to 505
03:00;If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
03:07;In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
03:14;With your hands between your thighs and a smile
