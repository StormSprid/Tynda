00:17;When I stare in your eyes
00:21;You'll be there forever
00:25;To watch our life (to watch our life together)
00:29;You just like going to Heaven (my heart)
00:33;Oh where are you taking me? (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
00:41;I'm fallin' and I'm drownin'
00:46;But you're takin' me
00:49;One thousand on my feet
00:50;Stacks spreaded on my seat
00:52;Ten thousand on my eyes
00:57; Rollie Pollie on my wrist
00:58; Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
01:01; 50K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
01:04; Emboldened by the bliss
01:06; I was sworn in by a kiss
01:08; Late from the country caters
01:10; No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
01:13; Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
01:15; New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
01:17; Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
01:19; Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
01:21; Three time to get me T-T-T'd
01:23; Still same phone, AT&T-T
01:25; Still givin' news very vividly
01:27; Beefin' up, fuck a beef
01:29; Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
01:31; I need no beef, no cheese, yeah
01:33; Even when I eat, they cheat, uh
01:35; Every time we meet, naive
01:38; When I stare in your eyes
01:42; You'll be there forever
01:46; To watch our life (to watch our life together)
01:50; You just like going to Heav' (my heart)
01:53; One thousand on my feet
01:55; Stacks spreaded on my seat
01:57; Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)
02:00; Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
02:03; It's mad how I get so high
02:05; It's mad how you get me by (by)
02:09; Tell me, tell me
02:10; Tell me, tell me
02:12; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
02:15; â™ª
02:49; It's me
02:52; Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
02:53; Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
02:55; Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
02:57; Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
02:59; All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
03:01; Tell you demise, I went to my side
03:03; To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings
03:04; I had to decide
03:05; I replay them nights, and right by my side
03:07; All I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me
03:08; If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage
03:11; And save him a child
03:12; The things I created became the most weighted
03:13; I gotta find balance and keep me inspired
03:16; Yeah, yeah
03:18; That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
03:19; I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
03:21; I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
03:22; They got me fucked up
03:23; I put you on bus and take you around
03:25; A couple of guys inside of the school
03:27; I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
03:28; They say they the ones when they make the errors
03:30; Can't look in the mirror (that shit wild)
03:32; I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
03:33; No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
03:35; We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
03:36; We do it for rights, got 52 weeks
03:38; This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
03:40; This shit is forever and infinity
03:41; Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
03:43; I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
03:44; Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
03:46; Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
03:48; Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
03:49; Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
03:51; And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
03:53; Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
03:54; If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink
